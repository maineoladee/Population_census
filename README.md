# Population_census
This project focuses on the analysis of the census data of a town to prepare, process, analyze, and make informed data-driven decisions for future economic, social and infrastructural planning of the community. I will be using python programming, libraries to accurately pre-process data, make analysis, forecast, and recommendations.
